# fortranPrograms
A collection of programs created by me, using fortran 95. Compile with gfortran on Linux.

# To run
simply go into the folder of the program you want to run, and type **make**.
The makefile will compile the code for you, and remove any unnecessary files (.o files, not needed because the program is already built). Feel free to add to them, make them more complex, etc.
